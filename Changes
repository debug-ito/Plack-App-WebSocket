        [ENHANCEMENT]
        - (gh#1) Now on_established callback gets $psgi_env as the second
          argument. That way, you can change behavior of the connection
          according to query params etc. Thanks leedo.

0.02    2013-11-21
        [BUGFIX]
        - Sometimes installation failed because $VERSION was inspected
          before prerequisites were installed. This bug is fixed now
          that $VERSIONs are set by literals.
